        We spend months finding the best factories around the worldâ€”the same
        ones that produce your favorite designer labels. We visit them often and
        build strong personal relationships with the owners. Each factory is
        given a compliance audit to evaluate factors like fair wages, reasonable
        hours, and environment. Our goal? A score of 90 or above for every
        factory.
